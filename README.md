# emle-models

Model files and resources for EMLE. These are automatically cloned and managed
by `pygit2` when using the [emle-engine](https://github.com/chemle/emle-engine) package.
Alternatively, these files can be downloaded and placed within an
`emle/resources` directory within the cloned `emle-engine` repository.
